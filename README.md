Status: In Progress. Working with minor fault, the time delay is not correct thus it has a long time delay between LED blinks.

# Blink the LED when User Button is pressed on the STM32 NUCLEO-F411RE board (STM32F411RET6)  

## Introduction:  
Getting started with the STM32 NUCLEO-F411RE board using the free [EmBitz IDE](https://www.embitz.org/) on Windows.
To blink the LED when the User Button is pressed.
Based on [this article](./User Manuals/isildak_en.pdf) and used [this article](http://www.firmcodes.com/stm32f407-discovery-gpio-tu) to get it working.
Flashed firmware hex file using [ST-Link Utility](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html).
